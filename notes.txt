Material UI notes
1. Typography
- variant attribute = h1-h6
- variant attribute = subtitle1 - subtitle2
- variant attribute = body1 - body2 , body1 is the default variant of the Typography component

- component - example value will be h1 to h6, it will have same design but in html it will display the component as h1 for semantic html
- gutterBottom - is usually false, but once included as attribute it will add margin-bottom
